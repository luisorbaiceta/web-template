# Personal Web Template
Hi! Welcome to my personal template for web projects. The idea of this repository is to provide a batteries included starting point for your next project. It comes with a lot of
useful stuff that I hope you'll enjoy. Cheers!

## Architecture
The project is built using the [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) framework. If you aren't familiar with the next.js structure feel free to visit it's website and check their docs. They've done an amazing job!

## Styling
My choice here is `Tailwindcss`. I love the declarative feel you get and how fast someone new to your project can understand components styling. You'll find the `classnames` package to handle conditional styling
and ordering of properties.

## Testing
Playwright! ALWAYS!

## Others
TODO
